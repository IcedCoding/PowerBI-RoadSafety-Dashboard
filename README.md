# Power BI Road Safety Dashboard (2007–2018)

This Power BI report was created as part of a practice activity for the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The goal is to visualize improvements in road safety over the time period from 2007 to 2018 by state, aiming to meet the target of **1.02 fatalities per 100 million miles driven**.
